      <div id="title">Who's Fighting in the Syrian Civil War?</div>
      <div id="description">The Syrian Civil War is an ongoing armed conflict between the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad and his foreign allies, and various domestic groups and foreign powers seeking to remove him from office. According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, more than 570,000 people have been killed since the war broke out in 2011. We will explore who the main actors of the conflict are, as well as the complicated relationship between each of the factions.</div>
